                    Pure vegetarian paradise! Paneer tikka and dal makhani were absolutely delicious. 
                    Very affordable prices and generous portions. The staff is super friendly. 
                    Perfect for vegetarians!

                    Good value for money. Food quality is consistent and tastes homemade. 
                    WiFi is helpful for digital nomads. Gets crowded during lunch hours. 
                    Overall a reliable choice.
