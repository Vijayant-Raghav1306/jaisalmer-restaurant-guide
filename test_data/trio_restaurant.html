                    Amazing dal baati churma! The authentic Rajasthani flavors were outstanding. 
                    Rooftop seating offers beautiful fort views, especially during sunset. 
                    Service was prompt and friendly. Highly recommended for traditional cuisine.

                    Good food but slightly overpriced for the portion sizes. 
                    The fort view is definitely the highlight. Dal baati was tasty but 
                    the churma was a bit too sweet for my taste. Overall decent experience.

                    Best Rajasthani thali in Jaisalmer! Every dish was perfectly cooked. 
                    The staff explained each item and its significance. A must-visit for food lovers.
