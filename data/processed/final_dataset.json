The city looks a stunning gold with sandstone structures, the culture and heritage is rich and the food in Jaisalmer is mouth-wateringly delicious. I was accompanied by some hardcore foodies so needless to say that exploring local food in Jaisalmer was high on our list. And that we did!",

We chose the vegetable momos along with a lassi. Unfortunately, they were among the blandest momos I’ve ever had. To make matters worse, several of them fell apart when lifted with a fork, as shown in the photos. The dipping sauce was really the only element that added any flavor.

When it comes to the food, everything was a delight. The portions are generous, the ingredients are clearly high quality, and it’s evident that each dish is prepared with care and passion. Lastly, the prices are more than reasonable for the level of service offered (for example, a 750 ml bottle of Coca-Cola costs 50 rupees, the same as on the street).
